**How likely is A.I. to replace our workforce?**

A.I., or Artificial Intelligence, has always captured the imagination of almost every medium. From movies, to comic books, and in passing conversation; Robots always seem to have a place in our future. Today, we use automated processes on a daily basis in everything from communication to microtransactions. Robotic Process Automation(RPA) is quickly becoming the solution to many issues companies face on a daily basis.

##**What is RPA?** 
The application of technology, used to digitize repetetive processes, or comb through large amounts of data quickly. An RPA tool can be as simple as generating a response to an email, or as complex as deploying thousands of bots, performing several jobs within a single network or Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. 

We will be taking a look at the occupations within the United States that are most likely to be automated in part, if not entirely. 

As we can see in the table below, the professions most likely to be completely automated (99% surety) are those with either a continuously repetetive process, face data that is extremely large, or has information processing that requires extreme precision. 

| Occupation | Probability |
| :------ |:--- |
| Cargo/Freight Agents | 99% | 
| Data Entry Keyers | 99% |
| Insurance Underwriters | 99% |
| Library Technicians | 99% |
| Mathematic Technicians | 99% |
| New Accounts Clerks | 99% |
| Processing Machine Operators | 99% |
| Sewers; Hand | 99% |
| Tax Preparers | 99% |
| Telemarketers | 99% |

The job sectors that are most likely to be automated are those that include occupations where an RPA tool is capable of processing large amounts of data more efficiently, allowing human controllers to identify relevant information faster. The overall result is that the business will save time and resources, providing customers with an elevated experience.

Of all the occupations measured, those with a probability of automation above 75%, account for almost half(48%) of the entire workforce represented. It is clear that RPA tools are becoming the go-to solution for improving upon business logic.
