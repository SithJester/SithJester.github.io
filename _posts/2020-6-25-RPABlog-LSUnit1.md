A.I., or Artificial Intelligence, has always captured the imagination of almost every medium. From movies, to comic books, and in passing conversation; Robots always seem to have a place in our future. Today, we use automated processes on a daily basis in everything from communication to microtransactions. 

Robotic Process Automation(RPA) is quickly becoming the solution to many issues companies face on a daily basis. RPA is the application of technology, used to digitize repetetive processes, or comb through large amounts of data quickly. An RPA tool can be as simple as generating a response to an email, or as complex as deploying thousands of bots, performing several jobs within a single network or Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. 

We will be taking a look at the occupations within the United States that are most likely to be automated in part, if not entirely. 


![Sectors](/SectorGraph.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}



As we can see in this table, the professions most likely to be completely automated (99% surety) are those with either a continuously repetetive process, face data that is extremely large, or has information processing that requires extreme precision. 

| Occupation | Probability |
| :------ |:--- |
| Cargo/Freight Agents | 99% | 
| Data Entry Keyers | 99% |
| Insurance Underwriters | 99% |
| Library Technicians | 99% |
| Mathematic Technicians | 99% |
| New Accounts Clerks | 99% |
| Processing Machine Operators | 99% |
| Sewers; Hand | 99% |
| Tax Preparers | 99% |
| Telemarketers | 99% |

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
